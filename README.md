# jsonfeed-importer
WordPress importer for [JSON Feed ](https://jsonfeed.org)

This is a very quick, very non-error checking importer plugin, shamelessly, but
awesomely copied from the WordPress [RSS Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rss-importer/)

While I should have copied, and likely will/maybe/possibly/eventually copy something a little
more fully featured like the [WordPress core importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/),
I just needed something that would import my formerly-wordpress-then-octopress-then-plain-jekyll-now-wordpress-again
[blog content](https://rambleon.org) in a way that would take advantage of how incredibly great JSON Feed is.

There's no error checking

There's no awesome support for all the JSON Feed features.

It's hardcoded to "User #1" (like the RSS Importer)

But, it worked, it was quick (like an hour, and that's not having written any PHP in about 6 years, and half of that involved
cursing about the DateTime object), and also it worked (Yes, that's redundant, but also, like awesome)
